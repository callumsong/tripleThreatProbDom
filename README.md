##Triple Threat Problem Domain

I took a very important part of basketball that most coaches teach their kids - the triple threat.

Essentially the triple threat is called the triple threat because you can do three things effectively - shoot, pass or dribble.

The problem domain that I thought would be relevant would be beating the defender. So I thought the factors that would affect the attacker and defender would be distance (from each other) and speed.

If the defender is slower than the attacker then it is good to dribble past the defender. If the attacker is slower than the defender and there is considerable distance between the defender and attacker the attacked should shoot.

My illustrated problem domain is below:
